Robotics is a multidisciplinary field that integrates knowledge of mechanics, electronics, computer science, artificial intelligence, control engineering, and physics. It is also applied in education as a teaching tool. The World Robot Olympiad™ Association, established in 2004, is a non-profit organization that coordinates an international competition involving more than 93 countries from around the world.

To create a robot, a solid knowledge in programming, electronics, mechanics, and related areas is required. It is necessary to use tools and components such as sensors, controllers, motors, batteries and construction materials, depending on the type of robot that you want to develop.

The mechanical structure of a manipulator robot is generally made up of a series of rigid bodies called links, which are connected by means of rotation or translation mechanisms that function as joints.

Educational robotics is a subdiscipline that focuses on the design, analysis, application and operation of robots in the educational field. It can be taught at all educational levels, from kindergarten to postgraduate. Additionally, robotics can be used as a tool to encourage and facilitate the teaching of disciplines such as computer programming, artificial intelligence, and engineering design. This discipline has evolved since the twenties and has acquired great importance in education, following a methodology that highlights its influence on the development of multiple intelligences and establishing specific objectives. It also plays an important role in serving students with special educational needs.

The controller of a robot is the component in charge of processing the information captured by the sensors and regulating the movement of the motors or other output devices, following the instructions of the stored program.

Sensors play a crucial role in robotics. Some important examples are motion sensors, which detect the presence of objects without the need for physical contact, speed sensors, which improve the dynamic performance of robots, and light sensors, among others.

Robots offer a wide range of benefits to humans. They can perform various functional tasks, provide information, provide education, and entertainment. However, its most important function is to help and assist children, the elderly and people with disabilities, improving their quality of life.
What does the robotics kit contain?
The programming, which is the most important thing for the robot to perform its necessary functions, was downloading the application on a computer since it is very difficult on cell phones because this application is very old, so we were assembling blocks with the necessary purpose of fully meeting our expectations. and without any problem but this became complicated along the way since it was difficult for us to understand this application since it was old school and the one that we know how to use perfectly cannot be used with the type of intelligent brick that we have at Hand we were learning with our tutor about how to get the robot to avoid detecting lines, colors and mainly that it does not collide with the walls at the time of the contest. Perhaps we will have difficulties in competition but we will continue until the end.
Robotics kits are made up of a series of electronic modules that include a programmable motherboard to control the systems, the motor to direct the robot's movements, light and infrared sensors, a bluetooth module, batteries and another series of components necessary for make the team work
The World Robotics Olympiad (WRO®) is a competition aimed at teams of children and young people between the ages of 8 and 19 who measure their knowledge using STEAM education through educational robotics, with the aim of to solve the different challenges that promote logical thinking, creativity and their ability to solve problems in a fun and exciting way.
The robotic vehicle is a programmable machine capable of performing a series of actions autonomously or semi-autonomously. The robot is built with the LEGO MINDSTORMS EDUACTIONS EV3 edition. The robot is made up of the following specifications that make it an extraordinary device, it has a lower part, an upper part, a front part and a rear part, to be specific, many types of lego blocks were used, but mainly there is a device that is needed to give all the movement. necessary of the robot and it is the intelligent brick ev3 this to explain it in a few words is that it makes the robot not collide with what it sees in the front part to the
just like it contains the line sensors, colors among other things that are fenced by also adding the motors as well as the electrical components
Robots that participate in the “Robotracer” category are also called “Robotracers”. A Robotracer (robot) is a small-scale autonomous vehicle, whose objective is to travel through a scenario established under standardized rules, in the best possible time.
I will talk specifically about the robot, it is made up of types of blocks, each one has its function to connect each piece until it has a robot, in this case, in the form of a vehicle that has movement, among its main blocks is the intelligent brick, the line sensors. and colors it also has the motors that give movement to the part where the tires go. All this was put together so that we could have the final result, which was the photos that they were previously able to appreciate about our robot.
The intention of the robot is that it detects the walls and colored traffic lights with the sensors to avoid colliding with them. The robot is programmed with structured rules in such a way that it makes decisions quickly and accurately already put into the programming.
Some of the programming of the robot is to see the lines. An autonomous robot with the ability to follow a trajectory marked by a black line on a white background in the shortest possible time, the track can have closed angles and forks. The robot that completes the journey in the shortest time wins the competition. A robot that will advance in a straight line as long as it does not detect any obstacle; In case of detecting any obstacle, it will turn on itself until it avoids the object.
In the programming you can make several modifications to the robot such as giving it to make it detect the lines and cubes.
The robot drives on 4 normal wheels. It has 2 axles, plus 1 motor for steering. – Driven on wheels and/or axles separately. - Differential drive = 2 motors driving different wheels (left / right) separated from each other.
The robot has the following areas: Use of artificial vision and sensor fusion to estimate the state of parkour and the vehicle itself.
● A work vehicle with open source hardware, such as electromechanical components and controllers.
● Action planning and control of robots with moving parts and kinematics other than differential drive (for example, steering).
● Optimal strategies to solve the mission, including the stability of the mission resolution.
● Teamwork, communication, problem solving, project management, creativity.
  ● An engineering journal to show design strategies and progress.
The robot must complete the following: Open Challenge - The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with random locations on the inside walls of the track. Obstacle Challenge: The vehicle must complete three (3) laps on the track with randomly placed green and red traffic signals. Traffic signals indicate which side of the lane the vehicle should follow. The traffic signal to keep to the right side of the lane is a red pillar. The traffic signal to keep to the left side of the lane is a green pillar. The vehicle's continuation to the third turn is indicated by the last traffic sign of the second turn. A green traffic signal indicates that the robot should go ahead and continue the third round in the same direction. A red traffic signal indicates that the vehicle must turn around and complete the third turn in the opposite direction. The vehicle is not allowed to drift or knock down traffic signs. The initial direction the car should drive on the track (to the right or to the left) will vary in different challenge rounds. The starting position of the car, as well as the number and location of the road signs, are randomly defined before the round (after the control time). The following graphic shows the playing field with the game objects.
The playing field or track The playing field represents a racing track where traffic signals are placed (represented by colored obstacles - pillars). The track consists of eight sections: four corner sections and four straight sections. Corner sections are marked with red dashed lines in Figure 2. Straight sections are marked with blue dashed lines. During the obstacle challenge rounds, the red and green pillars will be installed on the race track as road signs. The distance between the edges of the track will always be 1000.
determined in the previous step. The thick black line on the card means the inside edge of the playing field. The card should not be returned to the box. take one again.
